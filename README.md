# Dog Breed Classifier project

In this project I wrote a software pipeline that classifies dog breeds using a CNN. It also involves the use of a SVM to differentiate between human and dog faces and then uses the CNN to try and predict the breed of the dog or what breed the human looks like. 

The pipeline was then used as a demo available at this public facing URL.
